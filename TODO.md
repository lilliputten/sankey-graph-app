# TODO

- 2023.11.27, 01:23 -- Clean changed data (names, colors) in `SankeyAppDataStore` on a new data set load.
- 2023.11.24, 02:09 -- To initialize the settings (`SankeySettingsPanel`,
  `SankeyAppSessionStore`) from the url query.
- 2023.11.24, 02:07 -- To load chart libraries dynamically? (Needs to be
  ensured that it works in the embedding browser. And to preserve the way to
  use old approach with static loading.) See `useChartComponent`,
  `SankeyAppSessionStore`.
